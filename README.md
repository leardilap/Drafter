# Idea
- any usb keyboard -> transparent forward to PC as well
- [e-ink screen x3](https://www.exp-tech.de/displays/e-paper-e-ink/8887/waveshare-2.9-e-ink-raw-display-panel-three-color-296x128?c=1424)
- tinyFPGA-EX
- [ER-TFT0784-1 IPS TFT IoT LCD Display 1280x400 MIPI](https://www.buydisplay.com/7-84-inch-bar-style-ips-tft-iot-lcd-display-1280x400-mipi-for-car-monitor)
- [contition circuits to make the screen work](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4224)
- 3d printed case
- uSD card to save files -> in tinyFPGA-EX already, should be visible from the PC to copy and edit the files later on
- Firmware to print basic menu in screen and decode the keys and print in screen -> try to find a keyboard FPGA code already
- firmware also bypasses all keystrokes to connect directly to PC

## additions
- battery
- solar cell
- circuit to charge battery
- have stored in the uSD [musicforprogramming](https://musicforprogramming.net) or similar to play music tracks which help in concentration
- this requires headphone jack and sound output circuit
